Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? 

A block element always starts on a new line and takes up as much width as possible. An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as is necessary.


    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

When an element is placed absolutely it will remain at a fixed location on the page defined by it’s top, left, bottom and right attributes unless it has a parent element and then it will remain fixed in relation to that element.



    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?  

Set the width property to “auto” – `width: auto`



    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

Display block- <div>, <h1>-<h6>, <header>
Display inline- <span>, <a>
Display inline-block- <textarea>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

The box model is a way of containing HTML content. It applies margins, borders and padding around the content. The values of margins borders and padding can be zero but are mostly used to position content relative to other content on the page. Padding clears an area around the element. Borders can be visible or not and clear a defined space around the padding. A margin clears space outside of the border. By adjusting each item in the “box” you can precisely position your element.

In the traditional box model when we give an element a dimension it will include the borders and padding in that dimension. Example- we want our paragraph to be 200px wide. In the traditional model after setting our dimensions the paragraph will be rendered 200px + border dimension + padding dimension, so your paragraph would be displayed larger than the height or width you set.

The fix for this is to use the box-sizing property with a value of border-box - `box-sizing: border-box;’ . The box-sizing property lets us include the padding and border in the dimension. If you use the border-box value then the content, padding and border are included in the dimension. If you do not use the border-box value the default value of content-box is used and this includes only the content and will render the element in the traditional box model way.
